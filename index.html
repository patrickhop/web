        Thinking Machines Lab is an artificial intelligence research and product company. We’re building a future where everyone has access to the knowledge and tools to make AI work for their unique needs and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        While AI capabilities have advanced dramatically, key gaps remain. The scientific community’s understanding of frontier AI systems lags behind rapidly advancing capabilities. Knowledge of how these systems are trained is concentrated within the top research labs, limiting both the public discourse on AI and people’s abilities to use AI effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are scientists, engineers, and builders who’ve created some of the most widely used AI products, including <a href="#">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="#">Character.ai</a>, open-weight models like <a href="#">Mistral</a>, as well as open-source projects like <a href="#">PyTorch</a>, <a href="#">OpenAI Gym</a>, and <a href="#">Fairseq</a>.

      <h2 class="main-page-title">Solid foundations matter</h2>
      <p><strong>Model intelligence as the cornerstone.</strong> In addition to our emphasis on human-AI collaboration and customization, model intelligence is crucial and we are building models at the frontier of capabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Infrastructure quality as a top priority.</strong> Research productivity is paramount and heavily depends on reliability and efficiency.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="main-page-title">Learning by doing</h2>
      <p><strong>Research and product co-design.</strong> Products enable iterative learning through deployment, while great products and research strengthen each other.</p>

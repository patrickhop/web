## The Future of AI is Open

*We believe that the future of AI is open and collaborative.*

### Why Openness Matters

> The development of AI should not be concentrated in the hands of a few. By open-sourcing our research and models, we aim to democratize access to AI and foster a more inclusive and collaborative research community.

### The Power of Collaboration

We are committed to working with the broader AI community to advance the state of the art. Here are some of the ways we are collaborating with others:

-   **Open Source Projects:** We contribute to and release open source projects.
-   **Research Partnerships:** We partner with academic institutions and other research labs.
-   **Community Events:** We host workshops, seminars, and other events to bring researchers together.

### A Call to Action

Here’s a simple Python script to illustrate how you can get involved:

```python
import tml_hub

# List available open-source models
models = tml_hub.list_models()
print("Available models:", models)

# Download and use a model
model = tml_hub.load("draco-research/open-model-v1")
print("Model loaded successfully!")
```

### Our Open Source Contributions

| Project               | Description                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **TML Hub**           | A platform for sharing and collaborating on models.|
| **Open-Model-v1**     | Our first open-source large language model.       |
| **AI Toolkit**        | A collection of tools for building AI applications.|

And here's a more complex equation, the Schrödinger equation: $i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = [-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t)]\Psi(x,t)$
